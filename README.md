react-three-fiber is a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/codebase-overview.html#renderers">React renderer</a> for threejs.

Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components that react to state, are readily interactive and can participate in React's ecosystem.

```bash
npm install three @types/three @react-three/fiber
```

#### Does it have limitations?

None. Everything that works in Threejs will work here without exception.

#### Is it slower than plain Threejs?

No. There is no overhead. Components render outside of React. It outperforms Threejs in scale due to Reacts scheduling abilities.

#### Can it keep up with frequent feature updates to Threejs?

Yes. It merely expresses Threejs in JSX, `<mesh />` dynamically turns into `new THREE.Mesh()`. If a new Threejs version adds, removes or changes features, it will be available to you instantly without depending on updates to this library.

# First steps

You need to be versed in both React and Threejs before rushing into this. If you are unsure about React consult the official [React docs](https://react.dev/learn), especially [the section about hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react). As for Threejs, make sure you at least glance over the following links:

1. Make sure you have a [basic grasp of Threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene). Keep that site open.
2. When you know what a scene is, a camera, mesh, geometry, material, fork the [demo above](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber#what-does-it-look-like).
3. [Look up](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) the JSX elements that you see (mesh, ambientLight, etc), _all_ threejs exports are native to three-fiber.
4. Try changing some values, scroll through our [API](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) to see what the various settings and hooks do.

Some helpful material:

- [Threejs-docs](https://threejs.org/docs) and [examples](https://threejs.org/examples)
- [Discover Threejs](https://discoverthreejs.com), especially the [Tips and Tricks](https://discoverthreejs.com/tips-and-tricks) chapter for best practices
- [Bruno Simons Threejs Jouney](https://threejs-journey.com), arguably the best learning resource, now includes a full [R3F chapter](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/what-are-react-and-react-three-fiber)
